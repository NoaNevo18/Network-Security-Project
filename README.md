# Network-Security-Project
Final project in Cisco &amp; Networking module, Cyber Security course, HackerU

This project simulates a LAN of a new branch of an organization, which I had to configure both in the aspect of network configurations and connectivity, and the aspect of network security configurations. The topology of the network with its configurations were all created and implemented on the Packet Tracer software.

Here are the main configurations I implemented:
 
*Subnetting and designing an IP scheme
*Setting and configuring VLANs and trunks
*Assigning IP addresses based on the IP scheme I made
*Configuring Inter-VLAN routing
*Securing switches physical ports
*Configuring OSPF
*Configuring initial and security settings for network devices
*Configuring secure remote access
*Configuring Extended ACL
